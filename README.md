# TommytheAlien

This is a public repo of my first coding project and my submission for evolveU's project 1! 
I have posted this for testing purposes to both find bugs/issues, as well as to field
recommendations from anybody who wants to play the game at this stage!

To play:
-clone repo in your command line with "git clone (link)"
-install dependancies with "npm install"
-run the program with "node app.js"
-open your browser to "localhost:3000"
-ENJOY!
