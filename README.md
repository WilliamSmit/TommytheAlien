# TommytheAlien
This is a public repo of my first coding project and my submission for evolveU's project 1! I have posted this for testing purposes to both find bugs/issues, as well as to field recommendations from anybody who wants to play the game at this stage! 

### *Note*
If you do not have mongodb installed on your machine to run as a *service*, you will not be able to access the required localdb.

### *To play:*

3. Navigate within command line to the correct directory with -> $cd ./TommytheAlien
4. Install dependancies in command line with -> $npm install
5. Run the program from command line with -> $node app.js
