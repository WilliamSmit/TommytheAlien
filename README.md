# TommytheAlien
## This is a public repo of my first coding project and my submission for evolveU's project 1! I have posted this for testing purposes to both find bugs/issues, as well as to field recommendations from anybody who wants to play the game at this stage! 

### *To play:*
1. Navigate to your desired directory *(where you want to clone the repo)*
2. Clone the repository in your shell's command line with "git clone (link)"
3. Navigate within command line to the correct directory *i.e.*(../TommytheAlien)
4. Install dependancies in command line with *"npm install"*
5. Run the program from command line with *"node app.js"*
6. Open your browser to *"localhost:3000"*
7. ENJOY!

#### *Note*
If you do not have mongodb installed on your machine to run as a *service*, you will not be able to access the required localdb. To correct this -> don't ask me, I'm new.
